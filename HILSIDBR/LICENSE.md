The files located in the `patches/` folder are part of the OTEX texture pack and are subject to the following terms:

---

You are free to redistribute, wholly or partially, these assets with your
levels, but I ask that you please do not modify lump or texture names.

You are free to modify these textures as you see fit, but please consider
using patches to form new textures where possible, rather than adding new
lumps.

Kindly also mention me in the credits as "Ola BjÃ¶rling (ukiro)".

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you make some alteration you think
is useful for others, as I may then opt to include it future versions.

You may not use the material for commercial purposes.
